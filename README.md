Divine Events — Multi-page static starter
----------------------------------------
This package contains a modular, mobile-first multi-page static website for 'Divine Events'.
It uses Unsplash / Source URLs for images (free to use). If you want to download images into the 'images' folder,
run the included download_images.sh script on a machine with internet (Linux / macOS / Termux).

Files:
- index.html
- services.html
- gallery.html
- contact.html
- css/style.css
- js/app.js
- images/ (empty — images are referenced via Unsplash URLs)
- download_images.sh (optional script to grab sample images)

How to use:
1. Edit js/app.js and replace PHONE with your WhatsApp number (international format, e.g. +919876543210).
2. Commit files to a GitHub repo named 'divine-events' (or any name).
3. Deploy using GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → main branch / root) or Netlify/Vercel.
4. To add your own photos, upload into images/ and update paths in HTML/JS.

If you want, I can create a ZIP and provide it for download (this workspace already generated one).
